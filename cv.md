## About me

I am 18 years old, I am a student of the Higher School of Economics, educational program Information Science and Computation Technology. I hate the process of studying at university, so now I am studying on my own in two courses: Frontend developer and UX/UI-designer. I chose these courses because this is what I like to do the most and develop in this direction. I hope that in the next six months to a year I will be able to become financially independent and become a useful part of society. I already worked on the exam for tens of hours a week in 2024, so I think I can do it again and get to the end of course.
